# Alumni Network

A fictional network for alumni of my university course, "Digital media production".

Built as a Vue.js web app and simulated entirely on client-side, **there is no backend and no data-syncing**.

## Instructions
> Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
> Serve development version with HMR on localhost:8080
```bash
npm run serve
```
> Run test suite
```bash
npm test
```
